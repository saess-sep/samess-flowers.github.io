I gave away my things a while back.  Not all of my things, I don't live in a barrel or anything, but a lot of them.  People were asking me why I did it, but I think there's one really great reason I can give.  I read the book "Goodbye Things", which talks about making the mistake of using things to define yourself.  I think that it's all too easy to substitute items for your personality.  I don't mean that in a rude or elitist way, saying that people who have things have no personality.  I mean is instead of being your authentic self, you allow items to define who you'd like to be, or who you'd like people to think you are.  Who you are isn't set in stone, but it's not something you can mask no matter how much money you spend on things to seem cool.

This was really driven home after I gave away my books.  I had a large collection of books that I never read.  I had read a few of them, don't get me wrong, but I had read less than half of them, probably less than a quarter of them.  I had many classics, both classic literature and classic science fiction.  There was no way I was going to read Les Miserables, War and Peace, and Crime and Punishment in the same day, month, quarter, year, or even lifetime if I'm being honest, but I bought all of them in one trip to the store.  I wanted to be the kind of person who read the classics, but that's not who I am.  I like reading cyberpunk trash and airport thrillers, because that's what I like.

After I gave up my books, I had a conversation with someone who didn't know me very well.  When I mentioned that I had given away my books, he was aghast.  He said that he didn't know who I was anymore, because he thought of me as "the person who reads books."  That confirmed everything I was worried about and gave me the confidence that I was doing the right thing.  I'm not "a person who reads books," I just wanted people to think that because it seemed like the kind of person I *should* be.  While I am a person who enjoys books, I'm not a tweed jacket-with-patches wearing latter-day scholar who reads the classics in the original Greek, no matter how neat that could be.  It's not me.  By giving away those things that falsely represented myself as someone I'm not, I not only learned something about myself, but I became a more honest and sincere person in my interactions with others.

That's (one reason) why I gave away my things.

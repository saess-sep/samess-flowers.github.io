I love naming computers.  I can't stand a computer with a default name, especially on Windows.  A good hostname boosts morale, empowers users, and makes machines easy to track across the network.

### Think happy thoughts
The best naming scheme I have heard of came from a senior admin at my company.  The theme was very simple: when a computer is set up, it's given a pseudorandom name that sounds positive.  Some examples:
* Wisdom
* Generous
* Excellent

The scheme was excellent.  It uniquely identified computers in a human readable way.  It boosted morale by encouraging positive thinking.  It didn't empower the user, but that was less of a concern to the admin who made the scheme.  He didn't like waiting on people to get back to him with a preferred name, and many users didn't care.  Choosing not to empower the user also allowed a business-wide, cohesive naming scheme.

### Enter the newb
I'm not pleased to say I broke that scheme, just shattered it.  I named two computers using that scheme (Splendid and Ganbatte), and then started looking for greener pastures.  I used a few different schemes, all small scale and mostly abortive.  

The largest scheme I attempted was using Fire Emblem character names, of which there are hundreds.  Magic users were Macs, with Windows computers getting all the physical classes.  This lead to some neat names: paired MacBooks Nils and Ninian, a trio of 14" Latitude named after Pegasus Knights, a bulky Precision named Oswin.  Unfortunately, there were also stinkers.  

The two that spring to mind most readily are Dorcas and Serra.  Dorcus (pronounced dork-uhs), is an obviously bas name.  It not only has the work "dork" in it, but it also rolls off the tongue like congealed grease.  Serra (pronounced sehr-ah) was less outright awful, but I was the only person who could find it.  Everyone else was looking for either a computer or a person named Sarah.

### Dispondency
After the ignominous failure of my Fire Emblem scheme, I gave up.  I asked users if they wanted a specifc name, and if they said they didn't care, I named it with the pattern of "FirstnameL" (e.g. SamE).  This is the worst naming scheme I've heard of.  It doesn't uniquely identify the host: there is a built in collision with that person's name.  It doesn't boost morale or empower the user: it's impersonal and it's lazy.  Every time I see one o.f those hosts on the network, I feel bad.

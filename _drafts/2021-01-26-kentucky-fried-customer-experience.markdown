Recently, in a moment of weakness, I got a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Being mortal, I didn't finish it in one sitting.  After throwing it in the fridge, I noticed something strange on the bucket: it had reheating instructions on it, but only for reheating it in the oven.  That got me thinking, "why don't they have microwave instructions?"  The conclusion I arrived at, and then confirmed experimentally, is that they only have instructions for reheating in the oven because reheating chicken in the microwave is a bad experience.  You absolutely can do it, but why should they suggest something that isn't great?

The next day, I took a piece of cold chicken and microwaved it.  It was leathery, dry, and somehow more greasy than ever.  It was food, legally speaking, but it wasn't great.  Then, I followed the instructions on the bucket.  I preheated the oven to 350 degrees, covered in loosely in foil, let the chicken warm up to "165 degrees internal temperature or until warm" (thanks lawyers and also salmonella), and ate it.  It was pretty darn good.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it was actually good, or worth what I payed for it, or anything so outrageous, but it was night and day compared to the microwaved chicken.  A solid "reheating gross fast food" experience.

It's a simple lesson, but important: even if it's possible or necessary to have a customer, client, or user be able do something in the wrong way, don't encourage them.  Guide them towards a better experience and they'll appreciate it.  With that said, KFC did not embed the chicken with foil to prevent microwaving.  Outright preventing less than optimal behavior is worse than bad instructions.  If they did that I would have been correctly and justifiably angry.  If only a certain fruit flavored computer company could take a less from a fellow culinary corporation...

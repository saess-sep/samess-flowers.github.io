I love naming computers, it's one of my favorite parts about my job.  I can't stand a computer with a default name, especially on Windows which has a terrible default "DESKTOP-#####" scheme.  A good hostname boosts morale, empowers users, and makes machines easy to track across the network.

### Think happy thoughts
The best naming scheme I have heard of came from a senior admin at my company.  The theme was very simple: when a computer is set up, it's given a positive sounding name from the top of your head.  Some examples:
* Wisdom
* Generous
* Excellent

The scheme was excellent.  It uniquely identified computers in a human readable way.  It boosted morale by encouraging positive thinking.  It didn't empower the user, but that was less of a concern to the admin who made the scheme.  He didn't like waiting on people to get back to him with a preferred name, and many users didn't care.  Choosing not to empower the user also allowed a business-wide, cohesive naming scheme.

### Enter the newb
I'm not pleased to say I broke that scheme, just shattered it.  I named two computers using that scheme (Splendid and Ganbatte (I got lucky and Ganbatte went to a ~~weeaboo~~ anime fan)), and then started looking for greener pastures.  I used a few different schemes, all small scale and mostly abortive, such as naming my personal computers after famous battles then famous Gauls.  

The largest scheme I attempted was using Fire Emblem character names, of which there are hundreds.  Magic users were Macs, with Windows computers getting all the physical classes.  This lead to some neat names: paired MacBooks Nils and Ninian, a trio of 14" Latitude named after Pegasus Knights, a bulky Precision named Oswin.  Unfortunately, there were also stinkers.  

The two that spring to mind most readily are Dorcas and Serra.  Dorcus (pronounced dork-uhs), is an obviously bad name.  It not only has the work "dork" in it, but it also rolls off the tongue like congealed grease.  Serra (pronounced sehr-ah) was less outright awful, but I was the only person who could find it.  Everyone else was looking for either a computer or a person named Sarah.

### Despondency
After the ignominious failure of my Fire Emblem scheme, I gave up.  I asked users if they wanted a specific name, and if they said they didn't care, I named it with the pattern of "FirstnameL" (e.g. SamE).  This is the worst naming scheme I've heard of.  It doesn't uniquely identify the host: there is a built in collision with that person's name.  It doesn't boost morale or empower the user: it's impersonal and it's lazy.  Every time I see one of those hosts on the network, I feel bad.

### Lineage
Now, I try to keep things simple.  When someone needs a computer upgrade, I try to suggest a name similar to the last one.  If your last computer was named Equinox, what about Solstice?  How about replacing Rise with Zenith?  It's simple, but it has a logical consistency that lets me tie the hostname I used to associate with that person to their new machine.  It hopefully boosts morale by giving their computer a cool name and by reinforcing the idea that people should stick around to get another name in the pattern.  I make a point of soliciting input, even if the user isn't super interested.  I hope that by having input, even in just saying "yeah, that name works" is at least a little empowering.  If the user has a different name, either in the same theme or a completely different direction, I always try my best to make it work.  Collisions prevent some, others are too long, but we can work together to find something they like.

### What's in a name?
After writing this long winded, rambling narrative about something many people never think about, even I'm wondering if it matters.  I think it does and that by taking care in small details, I'm helping make my network a nicer place.  So, the next time you're getting a machine ready for someone, maybe ask them what they'd like it to be called.

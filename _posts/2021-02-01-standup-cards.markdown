Today, I'd like to share a quick tip to help with the incessant meetings that now haunt your every waking moment: the standup card!  They're a simple little trick that helps keep your standup short.

### Anatomy of a standup card
The standup card is a regular index card.  Write today's date at the top of it.  In the body, list out briefly what you need to share.  The card limits you to a nice, short call out and keeps your thoughts organized.  If you have multiple people or departments that you need to specifically report to, mark their names so you can make sure that your remark to them is directed to them directly.  People can tune out (especially if a standup is too long), but they'll snap to once they hear their name.  Use only one side of a card for your call out.  If you find yourself running out of space, send an email or call a meeting because that's too much to say at standup.  Use the other side of your card for notes during the meeting.  Hold onto your cards, they can form a helpful record of what you were doing and what happened during standup!

### Using the standup card
What goes in the body is a bit different depending on what you're doing.  At my last job, where I was a training consultant, my part of the standup was reporting a daily tip for all of the ~~peons~~ regular trainers and sometimes reporting progress if I was doing an on-site training that day.  If we had some participants who we needed to keep an eye on we'd share that ahead of time (a failure in the course was a big deal and we needed to break that news early).  At my current job, as an IT janitor, I start morning standup with any new and unassigned tickets, then I do any remarks, reports, or requests specifically to the other people on my team, using their name.  Last, I cover **briefly** what I'm doing that day.  I have very few meetings, so I mention if I do, then mention any specific problems or assignments I'm tackling, and finally I mention any times I won't be available so my team knows where I'll be (and not be).

### Benefits of the standup card
The standup card helps me organize my thoughts before standup, keeps me focused, and makes sure I don't forget anything.  My public speaking skills aren't great, so it definitely helps to have a reference.  Since I started making standup cards, I also tend to put my foot in my mouth a lot less, since I don't need to come up with segues.  The only segue I need is saying the next persons name, or saying "and today I'll be doing x".

Hopefully you can use the standup card to help shorten your standup and organize your thoughts!

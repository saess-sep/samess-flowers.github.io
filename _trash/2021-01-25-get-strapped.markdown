A few times in my life, people have asked me for advice on a gun to buy.  Unsurprisingly, that happened a few times in 2020 as well.  I figured this might be a good anchor point for my general advice on purchasing firearms for new owners.  It's an overview of what to buy, what not to buy, who to buy from, and how to stay safe.  I'll preface this by saying that gun-people are universally pig-headed and stubborn, with incomprehensible brand prejudice and that any advice you get on guns to buy should be taken with a grain of salt.  With that out of the way, let's talk guns.

### Why get a gun?
They're awesome, that's why!  There are many reasons to get a firearm, I'll list a few:
* Home defense
* Personal protection/concealed carry
* Hunting
* Target shooting
* Competition
* Collecting

I have guns for most of those reasons.  I have guns to protect myself in my home and in the wild world, I shoot targets as a hobby (think of it like a louder version of bowling), I collect interesting and useful firearms and research firearms lore and arcana.  I'm also looking to start hunting small game as a way to get me out of the house.  Competition isn't exactly my cup of tea, but the shooting sports are fascinating and well worth consideration.  

However, most people who need advice on a new gun are usually in the first or second category.  For real or imagined reasons, they don't feel safe and they want the agency to make themselves safe.  The phrase goes, "God made all men, but Sam Colt made men equal."  There's truth in that.  A firearm is the single most effect implement you can use to protect yourself from others.  It doesn't matter how big they are or how small you are, it doesn't matter if you pump iron or if they're a karate master: guns kill everyone who isn't Ernst Junger.

### What to get?
There are three categories of firearms: rifles, handguns, and shotguns.  A rifle is by far the most effective of these three at dispatching anything living that isn't a bird in flight.  Handguns offer portability and concealment.  Shotguns offer arguable simplicity and are very lightly regulated.  I will be perfectly honest and up front:  I prefer handguns personally, but I'll never deny the effectiveness of a rifle.  Shotguns are less clear cut.  A shoulder-fired weapon is more usable, but shotguns have extreme drawbacks.  Let's discuss each in turn and give some examples of what to get.

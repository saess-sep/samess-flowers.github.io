Beginning last year, I began adopting minimalist principles.  There were a lot of reasons behind this, but that's a story for another time.  Today, I want to talk about some discoveries I've made for things you can't live without.  Obviously, you *can* live without these things, you won't die, but it would be very painful (for you).  These are the things that I wouldn't recommend people give away, even if it can be tempting.

### A bed and frame
Sleeping on the floor sucks.  A mattress is absolutely essential, and I'd say that a bed frame is essential too.  There are some special, "minimalist" mattresses that are very small and don't require a frame, but they require you to specifically buy a mattress.  Chances are you already have a mattress, so buying a new one seems wasteful to me.  As much as it is aesthetically pleasing to put a regular mattress on the floor, it really hurts your back.  Plus, if you have a carpet (like I do), there's kind of a funky smell you wouldn't expect down there.  Even when giving away everything else, keep your bed and frame.
